-- DESCRIPTION --
A two player Yahtzee game.


-- GAMEPLAY --
On each turn a player can roll the dice up to 3 times using the 'Roll' button. For the
second and third roll, the player must select the dice which they want to reroll (selected
dice are highlighted red). When the player is satisfied with the result, they may select a
category for which they want to score the dice. Each available category will show what
the current set of dice will score. The player with the highest score after 13 rounds
wins the game.
